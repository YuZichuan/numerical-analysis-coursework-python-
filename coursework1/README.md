This coursework is mainly about solving differential equations by numerical methods. 

There are a total of four sections in this corsework. 

The first section is Petrovâ€“Galerkin FEM for first-order differential equation (question 0-2). 

The second section is GalerkinFEMforsecond-orderdifferentialequation (question 3-4). 

The third section is the heat equation:Backward Euler in time and Galerkin FEM in space (question 5). 

The fourth section is the 2D Poisson problem: Galerkin FEM on triangular meshes (question 6-7).
